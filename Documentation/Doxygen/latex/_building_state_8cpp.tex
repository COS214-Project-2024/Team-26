\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of the \doxylink{class_building_state}{Building\+State} interface. 

This file currently contains no implementation as \doxylink{class_building_state}{Building\+State} is an abstract base class with pure virtual functions. Concrete state classes will implement these methods.
