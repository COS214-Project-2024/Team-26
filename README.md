# The-7 City Builder Simulator

This project is a demonstration of how to create a City Builder Simulator using software design patterns. It showcases how to implement a variety of features commonly seen in city simulation games.

### Project Overview
In **The-7 City Builder**, we used several design methods and patterns to create a dynamic city simulation. Key features include:
- **Building States**: Manage buildings in different states, such as construction, operational, or decommissioned.
- **Revenue Generation**: Allow government entities to collect taxes or generate revenue through various buildings.
- **Resource Management**: Enable special buildings to produce resources, which contribute to the city's growth and functionality.
- **Dynamic City Growth**: Let the simulation adjust city metrics based on population, infrastructure, and available resources.

### Project Structure
- **Compilation**: Use `make` to compile the project. A `Makefile` with wildcards has been created to compile all files automatically.
  - **Compile**: `make` 
  - **Run**: `make run`
  - There wil be input choices available to showcase the game
  - After each input character press enter and watch the game evolve
  - You can build buildings all the way to printing the city stats
  - Available Commands:
  - build  demolish  next  stats  tax
  - **Test**: `make test`
- **Directory Structure**:
  - All C++ source files are located in the `system` folder.
  - All design diagrams and documentation can be found in the `Design` folder.
